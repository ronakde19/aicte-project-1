# 🥔🌿 Potato Leaf Disease Detection System 🥔🌿

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting potato leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images to classify leaves as **Healthy**, **Early Blight**, or **Late Blight**. This system aims to help farmers and agricultural experts diagnose diseases early and take preventive measures.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of images of potato leaves categorized into three classes:
- **Healthy**
- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**

The dataset was provided by Edunet Foundation and preprocessed for model training.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Collected images of potato leaves from the Kaggle dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Applied image augmentation and resizing.
3. **Model Selection**: Used a CNN architecture based on TensorFlow and Keras.
4. **Training & Validation**: Trained the model.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed the model's accuracy using metrics like precision and recall.
6. **Deployment**: Implemented the model in a web application using Streamlit.

## 🏆 Results & Findings
- Achieved **97.8% accuracy** on train data.
- Successfully classified leaf images into three categories.
- Provided an easy-to-use interface for users to upload and analyze potato leaf images.
